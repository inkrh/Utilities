Backup repo of commonly used utilities and interesting data

If you're not me and using any of this (or if you are me and are too tired to think) - most files and projects on my account are really just snippets of bits and pieces or aide memoire and may need a few tweaks here and there to work. I tend to do this on my local copies and might check in changes I have time / need / inclination / lack of anything more interesting to do.

NB Some of the comments might be for previous iterations and might no longer be relevant so should not be seen as being accurate, precise, or relevant in any sense of any of those words, unless in conjunction with the word "not".
