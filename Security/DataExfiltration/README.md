# Short Data Set Exfiltration

Basic example of how to bypass I/O file scanning to exfiltrate short data sets in a scenario where images are allow-listed but text and file content is scanned and where most file-types are blocked by network filters
 
 Currently relies on factor, xxd, ImageMagick.
 
 Many improvements still needed
