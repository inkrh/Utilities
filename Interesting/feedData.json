They migrate with moving ice floes and need ice for rest between dives for food. But when summer sea ice shrinks  walrus are forced to swim to land for refuge.\nAs thousands of walrus come ashore  they congregate in large groups known as  haulouts.  These mass gatherings are dangerous and even deadly for the animals. Nearby food sources may be quickly exhausted. As walrus are easily spooked by humans  vehicles or even small animals they can trample one another in a stampede to the sea. Tragically  many walruses  particularly young calves  will die in the stampede.\nShrinking sea ice\nThis month  the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced that walruses have been spotted in early August near the village of Point Lay  Alaska on the Chukchi Sea. This marks the earliest known haulout for the walruses and signifies the ever-growing impact of receding Arctic sea ice.\nClimate change means sea ice is retreating earlier than in years past. Summer sea ice is moving north where waters are too deep for the walrus to successfully dive and feed. When the animals come ashore  they are farther away from their best feeding grounds and must make long commutes up to 250 miles round trip that are not possible for young calves. \nWhile the number of walrus in this year s haul out is not yet known they will continue to come ashore through early fall past years have seen haul out numbers of more than 35 000 walrus. \nWhat can be done\nResidents of Point Lay rally to protect the walrus which are an important cultural  nutritional  and economic resource for the community  by taking measures to keep them undisturbed  such as strictly limiting access to the haul-out area. But climate change remains the greatest threat to the walrus. Without action on the issue  sea ice will continue to shrink and the risk to walrus will continue to grow.\nTake action: Tell President Trump to prioritize our planet s future\n      ", "Title": "What is a walrus haulout and what does it mean for the planet?"}, {"URL": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WWFStories/~3/YS2BWwC_fTE/supporters-help-wwf-launch-emergency-plan-to-stop-myanmar-s-elephant-poaching-crisis", "Description": "Amid a dire poaching crisis  wild Asian elephants in Myanmar received swift and essential aid from thousands of WWF supporters committed to protecting this iconic species.

According to the World Bank  the textile and dyeing industry contributes to 20% of the world s water pollution.\nChina produces a large share of the world s textiles  both benefitting economically and bearing the brunt of environmental damage. Take  for example  the Changzhou Weile Dyeing Company  located in one of the many industrial parks scattered near Tai Hu Lake in the booming Yangtze River Delta near Shanghai.\nWeile  run by brothers Song Lingyong and Song Lingyan  supplies textiles to 40 countries  including the US  where Costco is a main client. Until recently  the factory was emitting putrid water and toxic gases into a region where ecology is already severely damaged by industry.\n I thought  if we can transform our dyeing factory to emit clean air and make money at the same time  would it not be possible to inspire our whole industry?  says Song Lingyan.\nIn 2014  Weile became the first textile company in the world to adhere to the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) Standard  an international standard co-founded by WWF to promote the use of fresh water in a way that is socially equitable  environmentally sustainable  and economically beneficial.\n With the tools developed by WWF and partners  the companies and industrial parks are able to become real water stewards with global and local impact   says Wang Qian  acting director for WWF-China s Yangtze program.With its long supply chains  outdated technology  poor wastewater treatment facilities  and  most important  low profit margins (Weile s is just 5%)  the industry is ripe for transformation.\nLast year Weile invested eight million yuan (about $1.2 million) to upgrade technology to improve environmental impacts  say the Song brothers. While that put a dent in immediate profits  the long-term payoff is huge: Song Liyong says daily production costs are down 20% 25%.\nWorking with both global brands such as multinational clothing retailer H M and small producers like Weile  which employs 160 people  WWF helps companies shift to more responsible water use by assessing the financial impacts associated with environmental risks  says WWF-China s head of water practice  Ren Wenwei.\nIn addition to facilitating individual efforts  WWF  the Chinese government  and the textile industry are working collectively to improve environmental standards and governance.\nThe Weile factory is an utterly industrial site concrete floors  40-foot towers of white cloth  and the thundering sound of machinery.

In 2015  tropical storm Erika wiped out an estimated 90% of the country's GDP. Hurricane Maria caused similar devastation. No country can cope alone with the aftermath of two natural disasters of this scale. While Dominicans may be too polite to point this out  Britain owes the island a considerable debt. First  we profited greatly from centuries of slave labour. Stately homes were built from the profits gained by working Dominicans to death. Then  we benefited from globalisation  which boosted our exports  while wiping out virtually all of Dominica's manufacturing sector. Today  we routinely fly abroad for cheap vacations  causing carbon pollution that makes natural disasters such as Erika and Maria more frequent and severe. Dominicans have had no say in any of these developments.
